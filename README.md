# PowNetRes_FC: Coupled reservoir-power system model with streamflow forecasts

PowNetRes_FC couples a reservoir operation model with a power system model. Reservoir operations are simulated using an ad-hoc python model, and the power system model is [PowNet](https://zenodo.org/record/4688309#.YHc5euhKguU). 

# How to run
